# Hilo
This is a guessing game where the player starts with 300 points and has the opportunity to guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the current card. The cards are numbered 1 to 13. A correct guess earns the player 100 points. An incorrect guess loses the player 75 points. If the player hits 0 points, the game is over.
